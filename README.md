This repo is home to the copied version of the google's mediapipe platform and will be mostly used to generate AAR (Android Archives) libraries to support the development of computer vision solutions for mobile platforms.

[MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) offers cross-platform, customizable ML solutions for live and streaming media.
